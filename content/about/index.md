## About Grant Garab
**Co-Owner of [WeAreHomeBuyers.com](https://www.wearehomebuyers.com) & Retired Marine**

As a retired Marine with over sixteen years of service to our nation, I, Grant Garab, have always been driven by dedication and resilience. In 2019, a life-changing motorcycle accident shifted my focus towards new goals and aspirations, both for myself and my family.


## The Turning Point
**Overcoming Adversity & Finding New Purpose**

The near-fatal collision that left me confined to a wheelchair for eight months, enduring over a dozen surgeries, offered me a unique opportunity for reflection. During this challenging period, I pondered my future and that of my wife and our three sons.


## A New Chapter
**Establishing WeAreHomeBuyers.com**

With retirement from the Marine Corps approaching and years of experience in assisting homeowners, I founded WeAreHomeBuyers.com. This venture was a culmination of my journey and experiences, combining my commitment to service with a newfound passion for real estate.
