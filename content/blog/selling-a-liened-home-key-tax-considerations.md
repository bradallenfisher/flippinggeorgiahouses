  - **Property tax** liens for unpaid local taxes
  - **Mortgage liens** from home loan providers
  - **Judgment liens** from a court ruling

Before you can **sell your home**, resolving these liens is paramount. **Property liens** take precedence over the seller's interests, meaning potential proceeds from the home sale might first go towards satisfying these debts.

Conduct a property lien search to identify any outstanding liens. This process will reveal the **type of lien** and the lien holder, ensuring you have a comprehensive understanding of what needs to be settled before you can **sell your house fast**.

  - Settling a **tax lien** or **judgment lien** often requires negotiating with the IRS or other creditors.

### Strategies to Release a Lien
