## Asset Liquidation: Selling Home Under Chapter 13

Navigating the sale of your home while under the constraints of Chapter 13 bankruptcy can feel like a daunting endeavor. Yet, with the right guidance and understanding of the legal intricacies involved, this process can be an integral step towards debt relief and financial stability. We aim to provide a clear outline of the options and solutions available for asset liquidation under these circumstances.

### Understanding Chapter 13 Bankruptcy and Your Home

Chapter 13 bankruptcy is a court-approved repayment plan that provides debtors with an opportunity to reorganize their finances. Selling your house while in a Chapter 13 plan can be complex and requires careful consideration of your mortgage, equity, and the bankruptcy court's regulations.

**Mortgage Payment:** The relationship between your mortgage payment and your bankruptcy plan is crucial. Keeping up with your mortgage payments is an essential aspect of maintaining your Chapter 13 plan in good standing.

**Bankruptcy Court and Trustee:** Prior to making any decisions about selling your home, it's imperative to involve the bankruptcy court and the trustee overseeing your case. They play a pivotal role in the process and their approval is mandatory.

### Selling Your House Under Chapter 13

When you decide to sell your house during Chapter 13 bankruptcy, you must obtain **court approval**. This involves filing appropriate motions with help from your **bankruptcy attorney**, who can navigate the legal requirements on your behalf.

#### Steps for Selling Your Home

1. **Contact Your Bankruptcy Attorney:** Engage with your bankruptcy lawyer to discuss your intent to sell and the potential consequences for your repayment plan.

2. **Must File a Motion:** Your attorney will help you file a motion with the bankruptcy court, outlining the reasons for the sale and how it will affect your bankruptcy plan.

3. **Get Permission from the Bankruptcy Court:** The court will review the motion, considering the best interests of both you and your creditors, before granting permission to proceed.

4. **Sale Price and Equity:** Work with a real estate broker to determine a fair sale price. Any equity you have in the home must be accounted for, as it may be used to pay creditors.

5. **Bankruptcy Trustee's Role:** The trustee will oversee the sale to ensure all proceeds are distributed appropriately among creditors.

### Potential Outcomes Post-Sale

After obtaining permission from the court and selling the home, the money after the sale will be used to address outstanding debts.
