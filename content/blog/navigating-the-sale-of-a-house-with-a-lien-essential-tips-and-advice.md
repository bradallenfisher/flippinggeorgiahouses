## Selling a House with a Lien

Selling a house with a lien can appear daunting, but with the right approach and understanding of the process, homeowners can navigate this challenge successfully. A lien is a legal claim on a property that must be paid off when the property changes hands. Whether it's a mortgage lien, a property tax lien, or another type of lien, resolving these claims is crucial before completing a home sale.

## Understanding Liens

### Types of Liens
Liens can be voluntary, such as a mortgage lien when you take out a loan to buy a house, or involuntary, like a tax lien for unpaid property taxes.

### Involuntary Liens
These occur without the property owner's consent, often due to unpaid debts.

### Judgment Liens
Result from a court ruling where the debtor is ordered to pay a creditor, leading to a lien on their property.

### Mortgage Liens
This type of lien secures the mortgage loan and is placed on your property when you take out the loan.

### Property Tax Liens
Local governments may place a lien on a home if the owner fails to pay property taxes.

## Consequences of Having a Lien on Your Property
A lien can prevent the sale or refinancing of a property, as it signifies that a debt is owed. **Banks send Act 91 notice of foreclosure letters when homeowners have defaulted on their mortgages**, indicating a mortgage lien.

## Resolving and Removing a Lien

### Paying off the Lien
One must **pay the lien** in full or negotiate a settlement to remove it.

### Release of Lien
After satisfaction, a lien holder provides a **lien release** to clear the title.

### Seeking Legal Assistance
Consulting a **real estate attorney** can be valuable in navigating the lien removal process.
