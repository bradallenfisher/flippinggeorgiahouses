## What to Do With an Inherited House You Don't Want

When you stand to inherit a property, you may find yourself in a situation where you donâ€™t want to live in the inherited home or manage it as a rental property.

### Inheriting a House: Understanding Your Options

Upon inheriting a home, it's important to assess your situation. If you decide to sell the property, remember that **spring and summer are the best seasons to sell** due to favorable weather and an active real estate market. If selling isn't your chosen route, consider turning the house into a rental property to generate income, or perhaps live in the house if it suits your lifestyle.

**First,** ensure you have legal ownership and the right to sell. **Next,** take the time to understand the current real estate market so you can price the house accurately. **Then,** prepare the property for sale, which may involve cleaning, decluttering, and possibly staging. **Finally,** choose whether to sell the house through a realtor or on your own.

### Hiring a Real Estate Agent to Sell Your Inherited Property

Hiring a knowledgeable real estate agent can streamline the selling process. They can provide a competitive market analysis, offer advice on preparing the home for sale, and handle negotiations. To find a reputable agent, you may want to consider referrals or research agents with experience in selling inherited properties.

The key here is the property's cost basis, which is its fair market value at the time you inherit it.

### Avoiding Capital Gains Tax on Your Inherited House

There are strategies to avoid paying capital gains taxes, such as using the home as your primary residence for at least two years before selling. It's also possible to reinvest the proceeds into another investment property through a 1031 exchange.

### Dealing with a House Inherited with a Mortgage

If the inherited house comes with a mortgage, you'll need to decide whether to take over the mortgage payments, refinance, or sell the home to pay off the debt. Consult with a financial advisor to understand your options and the implications of each choice.

### Taxes on an Inherited House: An Overview

Aside from capital gains tax, you may want to consider property taxes, inheritance tax, and possibly federal estate tax, depending on the value of the estate. Consult with a tax professional to ensure that all taxes are addressed correctly.
